                    <p class="my-4">I'm a computer engineer by training. During those academic years, I engaged with open source, volunteered, and led some students' movements.</p>

                    <p class="my-4">From 2009 to 2013, I worked intensively with Linux and other embedded systems on many levels of software development.</p>


                    <p class="my-4">Then I shifted my attention to the intersection of social impact and digital innovation by joining the <a href="https://fundacaolemann.org.br/en">Lemann Foundation</a> team.</p>

                    <p class="my-4">My role developed from supporting edtechs to improve learning outcomes in public schools in Brazil, such as Khan Academy and Scratch (2015-2017), where I gained a good perspective on technology in the K-12 sector in Brazil. This opportunity led me to take a leave of absence from the Foundation to work with product development in a bootstrapped <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/mgov">B-corp startup</a>, Movva (2018-2019).</p>
                        
                    <p class="my-4">I returned to Lemann Foundation in 2020, where my focus moved to work on <mark>how innovation can accelerate the pace of solutions to help the Foundation achieve its mission</mark>. Since 2022 I've been the interim head of the innovation team, reporting to the CEO and leading a team of two.
                    </p>
                                                
                    <p class="my-4">I'm always looking to understand the bigger picture by continually thinking about handling innovation that could tackle the most complex problems.
                    </p> 
                        
                    <p class="my-4">Nowadays, my experience lies in the zone between the social impact and innovation side. <mark>I contemplate potential technology breakthroughs and figure out how to "connect the dots" by working collaboratively with other organizations and mapping the challenges with technical expertise. Then, I help shape a product concept and follow up the roadmap until deployment.</mark>

                    <p class="my-4">I'm committed to innovation initiatives related to Lemann Foundation's impact: advancing Brazil's public education system (K-12) and leadership development.</p>
                    <p class="my-4">Here is a non-exhaustive list of what I'm currently working on:</p>
                    <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ Exploring technologies to streamline the assessment process in K-12.</p>
                    <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ Innovations in writing and reading Literacy assessments aiming to 10x improvements.</p>
                    <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ How can open-source SaaS add value to the HR process in the Government?</p>
                    <p class="my-4">Overall, my practice seeks to apply a product mindset and lean experimentation by formulating hypotheses, clear metrics, and tactics for validation.</p>
