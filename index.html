                    <p class="my-4">I'm a computer engineer by training. During those academic years, I engaged with open source, volunteered, and led some students' movements. From 2009 to 2013, I worked intensively with Linux and other embedded systems on many levels of software development.</p>

                    <p class="my-4">Then I shifted my attention to the intersection of <mark>social impact and digital innovation</mark> by joining the <a href="https://fundacaolemann.org.br/en">Lemann Foundation</a> team.</p>

                    <p class="my-4">My role began supporting educational technology startups (a.k.a edtechs) to improve learning outcomes in Brazil's public schools. I got involved with field implementations and pilots of Khan Academy, Code.org,  Scratch, and many others (2015-2017), where I acquired a good perspective on technology in the K-12 public sector in Brazil. This opportunity led me to take a leave of absence from the Foundation to work with product development in a bootstrapped <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/mgov">B-corp startup</a>, Movva (2018-2019).</p>
                        
                    <p class="my-4">I returned to Lemann Foundation in 2020, where my focus moved to work on <mark>how innovation can accelerate the pace of solutions to help the Foundation achieve its mission</mark>. In 2022, I served as the interim head of the innovation team, where I reported directly to the CEO and led the team's efforts. Now, in 2023, I have transitioned to the role of Innovation Manager, collaborating with an exceptional team.
                    </p>
                                                
                    <p class="my-4">I'm always looking to understand the bigger picture by continually thinking about handling innovation that could tackle the most complex problems.
                    </p> 
                        
                    <p class="my-4">Nowadays, my experience lies in the zone between the social impact and innovation side. <mark>I contemplate potential technology breakthroughs and figure out how to "connect the dots" by working collaboratively with other organizations and by mapping the challenges with technical expertise. In some cases, I help shape a product concept and follow up on the roadmap until deployment.</mark>

                    <p class="my-4">I am committed to initiatives supporting the Lemann Foundation's goals of enhancing learning outcomes in Brazil's K-12 public education system and empowering leaders addressing Brazil's most challenging social issues.</p>
                    <p class="my-4">Here is a non-exhaustive list of what I'm currently working on:</p>

                    <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ 1. Investigating how <mark>Artificial Intelligence can leverage LF impact</mark> in the short-term and long-term. </p>
                    <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ 2. Supporting Lemann Foundation and their grantee's organizations in developing (and deploying) their artificial intelligence strategy.</p>
                    <!-- <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ Exploring technologies to streamline the assessment process in K-12.</p>
                    <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ Innovations in writing and reading Literacy assessments aiming to 10x improvements.</p>
                    <p class="my-4">‚Ä¢ How can open-source SaaS add value to the HR process in the Government?</p> -->
                    <p class="my-4">Overall, my approach involves applying a product mindset and lean experimentation principles, which include formulating clear hypotheses, establishing measurable metrics, and employing strategies for validation.</p>
