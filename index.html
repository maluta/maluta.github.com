                    <h2 class="font-sans font-light uppercase mb-4">üëãüèΩ My Experience</h2>

                    <p class="my-4">I'm a computer engineer by training. During those academic years, I engaged with open source, volunteered, and led some students' movements.</p>

                    <p class="my-4"></p>From 2009 to 2013, I worked intensively with Linux and other embedded systems on many levels of software development.</p>


                    <p class="my-4">Then I shifted my attention to the intersection of social impact and digital innovation by joining the Lemann Foundation team. My role evolved from supporting edtechs to impacting K-12 public schools in Brazil, such as Khan Academy and Scratch (2015-2017), to gradually working on <mark>how innovation can accelerate the pace to help the Foundation achieve its mission.</mark> I also worked with product development in a bootstrapped startup, Movva (2018-2019).</p>

                    <p class="my-4">Since 2022 I've been the interim head of the innovation team, reporting to the CEO and leading a team of two.
                    </p>
                                                
                    <p class="my-4">I'm always looking to understand the bigger picture by continually thinking about handling innovation that could tackle the most complex problems.
                    </p> 
                        
                    <p class="my-4">Nowadays, my experience lies in the zone between the social impact and innovation side. <mark>I contemplate potential technology breakthroughs and figure out how to connect the dots by working collaboratively and mapping the challenges with technical expertise. Then, I shape a product concept and the roadmap until deployment.</mark>
