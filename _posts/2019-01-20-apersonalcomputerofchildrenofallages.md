_"Should the computer program the kid, or should the kid program the computer?" - S. Papert_


In this essay, from *1972*, Alan Kay highlights some powerful ideas on how technology address social problems, like educating our children. Note that most of the ideas are today materialized in 2019 through products like [Scratch 3.0](http://scratch.mit.edu) being access on touchscreen devices. 

Interesting reflections on the problem, on theory, on product development and limitations and scaling up.
