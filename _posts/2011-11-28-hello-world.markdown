title: Hello World

GitHub caught my attention to be a blog platform after Y! Hacker News came with a [history](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3235282). I'm loving blog using [GitHub](http://www.github.com). I'll not write how to [Blogging With Jekyll and Github](http://www.ksornberger.com/blog/blogging-with-jekyll-and-github/) because [Kevin Sornberger](https://twitter.com/#!/ksornberger) already did. Now my routine to blog is summarized in opening a text editor and _push_ ing to server, simplifying: 

	$ vim _posts/2011-11-28-hello-world.markdown
	$ git push  

Enjoy!
