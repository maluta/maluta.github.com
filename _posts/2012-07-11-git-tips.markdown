There are plenty of Git tips. These are *my* study reference and it's *always* updated. I strongly recomend that _you_ create your own ;-)

# 1. Partial commits

    git add -p FILE
    git commit -a

# 2. Submiting your branch

    git branch my_branch
    git checkout my_branch

    ## edit something ##

    git push origin origin:refs/heads/my_branch
    git push origin my_branch

    ## if you previously cloned the repo ##

    # to others;;;

    git clone ...
    git checkout -b my_branch origin/my_branch

    # if you already cloned.

    git pull --rebase origin my_branch
