title: Deleting ALL emails from Yahoo! Mail
---

I used [Yahoo! Mail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Mail) for a long time to store messages from _maillists_ and recently I decided to clean my InBox. I have sub-folder that contains more than 9999+ messages and wanted I quick way to clean it. 

First, from Yahoo! Help:

* [Delete emails in Yahoo Mai](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN3600.html)
* [How to delete or move email messages](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/mobile/SLN4110.html)

I noted that Yahoo **doesn't** provide a way to delete ALL messages from a folder but only the "visible" on web interface, in order to delete all messages I need scroll down the message until the end of the list and then select the "all messages" checkbox. This is impracticable in my case with so many emails. 

I've found just one solution to fix that. 

* Install [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) or any email application.
* Configure your account to use IMAP
* Fetch all the messages
* Select all the messages from the subfolder in question and **move it** to Trash folder on server.
* Empty Trash.

Yahoo! Mail with more than 280 millions of registers users doesn't implement a easy way to delete ALL messages from a specific folder is a huge design failure but maybe it's just an strategic decision only to reinforce the concept of unlimited space (now it's "_only_" 1TB) ... 

Since [big] data is money why delete messages?
