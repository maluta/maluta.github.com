This is a weekly newsletter of what I've seen in tech and thought was interesting.

Â» Slack [raises](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/slack-raises-a-huge-financing-round-from-softbank-valuing-the-company-at-5-1b/) a huge financing round ($250 million) from SoftBank valuing the company at $5.1B. Also, Slack released some features like [multi-language support](https://slackhq.com/bienvenue-willkommen-bienvenidos-to-a-more-globally-accessible-slack-546a458b21ae) (French, Germany, and Spanish) and allow [bring important emails](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206819278-Send-emails-to-Slack) into the chat tool. Maybe this is an experiment to attack e-mail workflow.
