<p style="text-align: justify;">Today I was curious about one <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/search/results.jsp?Ntt=tablet&amp;y=0&amp;N=110018&amp;x=0" target="_blank">tablet</a> commercialized at <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/" target="_blank">Walgreens</a>. Probably if you are looking for a <em>really</em> cheap tablet running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29" target="_blank">Android</a> you'll <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/search.dx/search.tablet%20android#317" target="_blank">check</a> DealExtreme, FocalPrice, etc (see <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.44080" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="http://www.focalprice.com/CE009W/Portable_2GB_Max_32GB_Android_7_TFT_LCD_Touch_Screen_MID_Tablet_Pad_Netbook__White.html" target="_blank">this</a> and also <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.39169" target="_blank">this</a>)  but when the largest drugstore chain in the EUA starts selling low cost tablets you just confirm the thesis that China is flooding world's market with prices that make a lot of people re-think values. Even with low-quality China brands are gain market share. The uninitiated user don't have the distinction about technical differences and mostly are taken by the price. If you search for Walgreen's tablet <a href="http://www.maylonggroup.com/M-150_MID.htm" target="_blank">specs</a> you can note that instead following the trends in usability opting for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_sensing" target="_blank">capacitive</a> touchscreen they used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistive_touchscreen" target="_blank">resistive</a> one. The processor is a Via VM8505+ based on ARM9 core, this chip comes without multimidia capabilities like Texas Instruments OMAP355x or Freescales IMx51 series. Poor processing means that applications will not run smoothly and 256MB of RAM restricts the number of apps running simultaneously. If you are interested about Via processor check this <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/vt8500-wm8505-linux-kernel/browse_thread/thread/50ade80cfa9aecc4/1b45a277b6acd252?show_docid=1b45a277b6acd252&amp;pli=1" target="_blank">link</a>. Keep in mind that today everything is software, in Android case choose the most recent version is always recommended but the company is commited with updates? Is it <a href="http://market.android.com" target="_blank">Market</a> available?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'm not in favor of disposable objects, even for not short-term durability like mostly gadgets today.  Indeed every two or three years the technologies change forcing us to adapt. If you bought low quality designs you are accelerating this process not to mention that the true usability goes away. Watch your needs before buy, not always the most hardware capable is the best option, but poors designs always affect in some way...</p>
