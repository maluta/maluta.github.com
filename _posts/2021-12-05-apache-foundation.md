I learned two more open-source technologies maintained and developed by Apache Software Foundation this year: Apache Superset and Apache NiFi. 

Here are some personal notes about Apache. 

I have used open-source software since the early 2000s. So I know about the famous Apache HTTP Server and other software, such as Apache Airflow, OpenOffice, or even the license with the same name: Apache Licence. So I'm not necessarily a newbie in the ASF world, but only when you look at the big picture do you note that there are so many exciting projects under the umbrella of Apache Software Foundation, or just, ASF. 

Writing this in 2021 means I'm examining 22 years of history. 

In 1999 Apache Group was structured as a non-profit organization. A critical movement to deal with the fast growth of the Apache HTTP Server.

> "The mission of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to provide software for the public good. We do this by providing services and support for many like-minded software project communities consisting of individuals who choose to participate in ASF activities."

» Apache [Airflow](http://airflow.apache.org/) | » Apache [SuperSet](http://superset.apache.org/) | » Apache [Nifi](http://nifi.apache.org/) |  Apache [HTTPD](https://httpd.apache.org/) 


> "Apache’s breakthrough technology touches every aspect of modern computing, powering most of the Internet, managing exabytes of data, executing teraflops of operations, and storing trillions of objects in virtually every industry. Apache projects are all freely-available, at 100% no cost, and with no licensing fees". 


At the apache.org website, you can watch a documentary that I also embedded below. Highly recommend!

Here are valuable elements that I see at ASF: 

- The concept of 'community over code' (or simply The Apache Way) is a grand vision to build the culture and a resilient organization inside the open-source ecosystem. 
- The way they look for the next generation in the Apache Incubation process.
- The openness in the communication process
- Member's passion for giving back to society (create more value than you monetize)
