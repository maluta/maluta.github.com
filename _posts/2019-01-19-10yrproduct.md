Products must iterate to be relevant for their users. For those who stay here with a market fit, some reflections:

- The product "facade" (e.g: the user interface) follows an incremental path. A lot of work to merge new tools and technology. Of course, radical changes are possible, but they are risky and companies tend to make them carefully. 

- The product "engine" (e.g algorithms and back-end stuff) are more prone to mutations and disruptive paths. For example, in the last 10 years, we saw a lot of theories in the field of AI/ML being deployed. That generated a huge impact in add user value to the users. 

- Products are cultural things for people. Because they shape behaviors and sometimes addict us for change come with a bag of pros and cons. 

- Hope to see in the next 10 years the "facade" and the "engine" more closely integrated. One example is the voice assistants who propose a new interface powered by powerful algorithms and data.
