Products must iterate to grow and to remain relevant for their users. For those who stay here with a sustainable market fit, some reflections:

- Products materialize an idea or concept and are "always in beta". If we take one specific niche like digital products we saw how they became cultural things for people. Because they shape behaviors and sometimes addict us... every release comes with a bag full of pros and cons.

- The product "facade" (e.g: the user interface) follows an incremental path. A lot of work to understand user journeys and "jobs to be done" plus merge new tools & technology. Of course, radical changes are possible, but they are risky and companies tend to make them carefully. 

- The product "engine" (e.g algorithms and back-end stuff) are more prone to mutations and disruptive paths. For example, in the last 10 years, we saw a lot of theories in the field of AI/ML being deployed. That generated a new set of possibilities and a huge impact on how products add value to their userbase. 

- Hope to see in the next 10 years the "facade" and the "engine" more closely integrated and frictionless. One example is the rebirth of voice assistants who propose a new interface fueled by powerful algorithms and data.
