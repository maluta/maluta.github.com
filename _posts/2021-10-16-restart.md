tl;dr I re-organized this space to rediscover my enthusiasm to publish things. 

My relationship with Github Pages isn't new. Almost ten years ago, on Nov 26, 2011, I submitted my [first commit on this repo](https://github.com/maluta/maluta.github.com/commit/c3db1c9806961b5bc7f86cdc433e947d6603cf3e). 


Since then, I'm exploring this space for "static storage" of web (HTML/CSS/JS) content. I love Github + Jekyll's workflow and as a technologist, using git seems a valuable tool.

Today on this repo, I hold different types of content, but I can summarize: 

- A blog. It's Jekyll-based, and that covers a lot of content from previous years. Most are technical subjects from my years studying computer engineering (2005 - 2010) and include migrations from my earlier blog on WordPress.
- A myriad of individual HTML pages, mainly to test new ideas. For example, like a genealogical tree from my family using D3.js.


Although I'm not the exact person who made the first commit to building this repo ten years ago, the foundations that make me publish are still present.

**I'm recommitting.** 

And for this (new) phase, I'm setting up some assumptions:

1. Be constant: quantity is more desirable than quality. 
2. Be vulnerable to publish things out of my knowledge domain.
3. Apply curiosity as a compass.
4. Invest in compounding knowledge
	
Some plans I expect to develop: 

- Learn in public 
- Use writing as a tool to bond my knowledge
- Build and release things that include technology 

I don't expect

- Don't spend time finding out a system for publishing. 
- Be perfectionist 
- Fail again :)
