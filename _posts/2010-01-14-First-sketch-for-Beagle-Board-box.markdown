<p style="text-align: justify;">This is my first approach to make a case for <a title="More information about Beagle Board" href="http://www.beagleboard.org" target="_blank">Beagle Board</a>. I used a plastic <a href="http://www.patola.com.br/" target="_blank">one</a> that fits almost perfect, needed basically a 12 <em>mm</em>. spacer to height adjust. The box would be like this picture:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-470" src="http://www.coding.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/bb1.png" alt="" width="357" height="363" /></p>

And the BB would fit, inside the box, more or less like that:
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-472 aligncenter" src="http://www.coding.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/bb2.png" alt="" width="392" height="394" /></p>

I still need consider some points:
<ul>
	<li>Even with an "natural" exhaust ventilation (no fan, not visible in picture) the heat influence on "heavy" use.</li>
	<li>Check all connectors and see if they fit properly.</li>
</ul>
I hope for the next weeks post more about this box and great ideas with Beagle Board.

Stay tuned!
