> Castor says her own success — and her career — hinges on two things: technology and Braille. That may sound strange to many people, even to some who are blind and visually impaired. Braille and new tech are often depicted as at odds with one another, with Braille literacy rates decreasing as the presence of tech increases.

I'm more and more interested in ways of supporting "Learnable Programming" (taking Bret's Victor [concept](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)). It's important to us understand how abstract our thoughts and how code and leverage this understanding.
