As a product owner building products for social impact and targeting B2B markets aiming to reach (and scale the impact) on the end-user I'm constantly trying to understand how can I improve my approach to correctly see if I'm making progress towards the balance between purpose and profit.

Recently I was particularly interested in focused on how can I establish better metrics for the client (a.k.a buyer)

My research led me to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0syFtxbkaoQ) on ["How to Have the Best B2B Approach in Product"](https://www.slideshare.net/productschool/how-to-have-the-best-b2b-approach-in-product-by-google-pm) by Google PM [David LeDonne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidledonne/)

In a nutshell, this video present 3 challenges (that I also face it) when dealing with B2B products:

- Feedback loops are long
- User data is scarce
- The buyer will often never use your product

With these constraints in mind, David's describes the idea of developing a point of view that resonates and that you and the team believe in is the most important thing to focus

**Understand WHY your customers are buying the product and WHO in the organization you are selling to.**

ACTIONS:

```
1) Talk to buyers, developer buyer persona's, understand buyer needs
2) Don't let user feedback get in the way of the product vision
```
