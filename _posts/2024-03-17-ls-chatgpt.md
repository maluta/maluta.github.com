In 2017, a friend introduced me to a website called **Liberating Structures** [1] (LS) which has never left my favorites since and became a reference for seeking inspiration for group activity dynamics. In 2024, I took a step in my user experience by integrating the LS base with ChatGPT. I created this using the [GPT Create](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts
) feature from ChatGPT.

Some _prompt_ examples:

- Explain "Wicked Questions" in Brazilian Portuguese
- Teach me about "1-2-4-All" like I'm a 10-year-old
- Show me an activity that would be suitable for asynchronous collaboration.
